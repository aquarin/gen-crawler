Google Datastore Accessor (at this stage):

* Upload an entity without transaction
* Query the top entity based on sorting, mark it as fetched in a transaction
  (for task queue)
* Read config from environment setting (to simplify the problem, damn Datastore API design!)

* No support of hierarchical entities

Entity Representation
=================================
(insert)
* Key String (must have) + Other Properties' HashMap + List of indexed properties

(fetch)
* string as key, map of rest of properties
